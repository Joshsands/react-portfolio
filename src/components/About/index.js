          <p>
            I started my full stack development practice with the UT Coding
            Bootcamp in Austin and will continue to hone my HTML, CSS and
            Javascript mastery while learning Ruby, PHP, Python and other back
            end languages.

            Web development is both my desiered career and newly found personal
            passion, but my road to this discovery was not straightforward. I
            started in the medical field where I first acquired my BS in
            Microbiology at Texas State University and then attended the UT
            Health Science Center in San San Antonio MD program.

          <p>
            After looking through several projects of friends and family in the
            web development industry I was instantly intrigued and learned that
            I had a high affinity and apptitude for programming languages.
